                    Leverj will hold the 30% of tokens for liquidity and operations. Leverj will stake most of these tokens in order to get FEE tokens. Leverj is therefore economically incentivized to hold on to these tokens and has no plans at present to sell large portions of these tokens on secondary market. As part of business development, some tokens may be given to financial institutions as part of partnership agreements that are likely to increase the net value of the system. Some may be given to incentivize new employees. In such cases, we will require lockout periods of sufficient length to ensure there is no major disruption in market value.
