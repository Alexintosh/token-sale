                    A fixed number of LEV tokens (1 billion) will be minted before the upcoming token sale - this will be
                    the only time LEV are created. Leverj is selling 40% of these LEV created in the token sale.

                    The secondary token, FEE, will have a varying supply adjusts based on the behaviour of Leverj
                    ecosystem stakeholders. Its market price will have a targeted range, with a game theoretically
                    designed system reinforcing it.
