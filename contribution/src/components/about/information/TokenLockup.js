                <p>
                    The token vesting schedule, shown below, has been designed to specifically align the long-term interests of the founding team with those of public token sale participants to maintain a consistent and healthy growth of the trading ecosystem. 
                    The long drawn-out vesting schedule also ensures that the team is continuously motivated and stays vested in the success of the project for a longer duration. 
                    Early exit of the core team also impacts the success of the project and thereby the value of the token.
