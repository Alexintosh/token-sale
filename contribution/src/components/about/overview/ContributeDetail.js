                    Leverj decentralizes the most desirable features of derivatives trading by implementing them in cryptocurrencies and eliminating points of friction. 
                    With a tight focus on derivatives trading and the supporting ecosystem, Leverj has taken the approach of defining the product first. 
                    We have built a functioning exchange with a usable UI (user interface), decentralized identity, and provable audit. 
                    We plan to decentralize the back-end and add ecosystem features that will enable large players to move into the cryptocurrency world.
