                            <p>Coinpit is taking significant and innovative steps to offer a safer alternative to Bitcoin's custodial futures exchanges. Thanks to Bitcoin's multi-signature technology, users that store bitcoins on Coinpit remain in complete control of their funds. Even if the exchange is hacked, goes bankrupt, or disappears completely, customers can in most cases still retrieve their money.</p>

                            <p>Coinpit is a futures exchange which offers futures contracts denominated in Bitcoin. Currently, they offer inverse USD/BTC contracts. More contracts will be added based on demand. Furthermore, Coinpit is a pure Bitcoin in/out exchange and does not deal with any fiat, which eliminates any exchange rate risk. When it comes to security, Coinpit uses multi-sig addresses where a user’s private key is never transmitted to the exchange.</p>
